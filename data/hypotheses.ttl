words:A3_RequisiteVariety a words:Hypothesis ;
  dcterms:title "Requisite variety (Ashby)" ;
  words:claims "Controller performance is bounded by environmental variety; diversity is required to match variety" .

words:A4_Goodhart a words:Hypothesis ;
  dcterms:title "You get what you measure (Goodhart's Law)" ;
  words:claims "When a metric becomes a target, it ceases to be a good metric" .

words:A5_ExplorationExploitation a words:Hypothesis ;
  dcterms:title "Exploration–exploitation balance" ;
  words:claims "Sustained performance requires balancing exploration with exploitation; insufficient exploration reduces diversity and novelty" .

words:A6_ContextIsKing a words:Hypothesis ;
  dcterms:title "Context is king" ;
  words:claims "Answer quality increases with relevant, faithful grounding context up to model capacity limits" .

words:A7_CausalGrounding a words:Hypothesis ;
  dcterms:title "Causal beats correlational" ;
  words:claims "Causally grounded features generalize better than correlational heuristics, especially under distribution shift" .

words:A8_PathDependence a words:Hypothesis ;
  dcterms:title "Path dependence and hysteresis" ;
  words:claims "Early design choices create attractors; switching costs and institutional inertia cause hysteresis" .

words:A9_SemanticLayerFirst a words:Hypothesis ;
  dcterms:title "Semantics precede scale" ;
  words:claims "A governed semantic layer is prerequisite for safe, scalable RAG and agentic systems" .

words:A10_ConservationOfComplexity a words:Hypothesis ;
  dcterms:title "Conservation of complexity" ;
  words:claims "Complexity is conserved across layers; removing complexity in one place displaces it elsewhere" .

words:A11_ConvergentStacksRome a words:Hypothesis ;
  dcterms:title "All roads lead to Rome (convergent stacks)" ;
  words:claims "Ecosystems converge on common coordination layers (protocols, semantics); fragmentation resolves toward shared standards" .
